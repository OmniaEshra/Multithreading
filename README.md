# Python Multithreading 
This is a simple Python script that demonstrates how to use multithreading to draw circles and rectangles at the same time. The script uses the Python threading module to create two threads, one for drawing circles and another for drawing rectangles.

### Usage
To run the script, simply run python drawing.py in your terminal or command prompt. The script will create two separate threads, one for drawing circles and another for drawing rectangles. Each thread will draw its respective shape in a separate window using the turtle module.
